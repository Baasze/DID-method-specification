# SAN DID Method Specification

Version: 0.1

Note: This specification will be updated and the version number will be bumped.

The system aims to provide secure authentication and various health services based on the SAN blockchain and DID & Verifiable Credential Specifications published by the W3C.

[Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#interoperability-registries)

## 1. SAN DID

The namestring that shall identify this DID method is: san

```
did:san:<method-specific-id>

did:san:abcdefgh1234
```

method-specific-id = 12 characters long and contains the characters a-z and 1â€“5

Basic DID Document:
```
{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/did/v1",
  "publicKey": [
    {
      "id": "#keys-1",
      "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1Signature2019",
      "publicKeyBase58": "H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
    },
    {
      "id": "#keys-2",
      "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1Signature2019",
      "publicKeyBase58": "H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
    }
  ],
  "authentication": ["#key-1"],
  "recovery": ["#key-2"],
  "created":< Created Date of DID Document>,
  "updated":< Created Date of DID Document>
}
```

## 2. Method Operation

### 2.4 Revoke
A DID document can be revoked by performing an HTTP POST.

}

## Security considerations

* SAN DID method uses the Byzantine Fault Tolerance-DPoS protocol to reach consensus.
* A DID owner can use recovery key to reset authentication key, but no one can access the verifiable credentials which were issued and encrypted by origin public key.
* SAN DID Document uses ECDSA secp256k1 to prevent malicious tampering.

## Privacy considerations

* The SAN DID method is architected to ensure reduced correlation risk.
* The public key will be used to encrypt data, only those with the private key can decrypt and access the data.
* The private key only exists on the user's device and will not be known to any third party.
